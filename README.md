# NoteFrame

ðŸ‘‰ [Visit the app â†’ notefra.me](https://notefra.me)

NoteFrame is a web app I built from the ground up to help people take better notes while watching videos. You just paste in a YouTube link, and you can start adding notes that are tied to exact moments in the video. Itâ€™s great for learning, research, or anything where you need to remember and organize what you watch.

## Why I built it

I'm currently looking for my first job as a developer, and I wanted to build something thatâ€™s not just a demo, but actually useful. NoteFrame is a full commercial-grade project I designed, coded, and deployed myself.

It reflects what I care about in software: solving real problems, keeping things simple for users, and building solid features end-to-end.

If you're checking this out as a potential employer â€” thanks for looking! This project is a good snapshot of what I can do as a solo developer.
